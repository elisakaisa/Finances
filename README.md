# Finances
App (first an API, then maybe I'll add a frontend) to keep track of expenses. 
Logic is based on the spreadsheet I've made that me and my partner have been using to keep track of our expenses and to split them accordingly.
The API should be able to calculate total monthly expenses by category and sucategory, as well as split expenses between users in different ways.

## Approach
ASP.NET API, using a SQL database. Code first approach using Entity Framework Core. Test-driven development. Controller-Service-Repository-Database Architecture.
